# 32bit Single-Cycle-MIPS-Processor on Verilog using Xilinx Design Suit ISE
This a 32bit single cycle processor simulated on Xilinx Design Suit ISE 14.5 written in verilog. This was my semester project at NUST College of EME as part of the "Computer Organization and Architecture" course.
This processor can perform integer operation and lacks an FPU.
You can download the "MIPS" folder and open it as a project in Xilinx and simulate the processor.
The schematic of the processor from which this was made is given below:

# 32-bit Single-Cycle MIPS Processor in Verilog using Xilinx ISE

This project is a **32-bit single-cycle MIPS processor** simulated using **Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14.5**. It was developed as part of my semester project at **NUST College of EME** for the **Computer Organization and Architecture** course.

The processor is capable of performing **integer operations**, but does **not** include a **Floating Point Unit (FPU)**.

You can download the **MIPS** folder, open it as a project in Xilinx ISE, and simulate the processor.

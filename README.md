# Single-Cycle-Non-Pipelined-MIPS-32-Processor

This is a single cycle MIPS 32bit processor simulated in verilog running on Xilinx Design Suit ISE 14.5. This processor can do integer operations and lacks an FPU.
You can run all three types of instructions which are R-Type,J-Type and I-Type.
The processor schematic diagram is shown below:
